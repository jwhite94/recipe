### Ingredients:

- 4 large bell peppers (any color)
- 1 lb ground turkey or lean ground beef
- 1 cup cooked quinoa or rice
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 1 cup of corn (frozen or fresh)
- 1 cup of black beans, rinsed and drained
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)
- 1 cup shredded cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, or a blend)
- Olive oil
- Optional: chopped cilantro or parsley for garnish

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven and Prepare Peppers:**
   - Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
   - Wash the bell peppers, cut off the tops, and remove the seeds and membranes. If they don't stand upright, you can slice a small portion off the bottom to level them.

2. **Cook the Filling:**
   - Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add a little olive oil and the chopped onions. Sauté until the onions are translucent.
   - Add the ground turkey or beef to the skillet. Cook until browned, breaking it up into small pieces as it cooks.
   - Stir in the garlic powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper, and salt.
   - Add the cooked quinoa or rice, corn, and black beans to the skillet. Mix well and cook until everything is heated through.

3. **Stuff the Peppers:**
   - Spoon the mixture into each bell pepper cavity until they are all filled up. Place the stuffed peppers upright in a baking dish.

4. **Bake:**
   - Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 30-35 minutes or until the peppers are tender.

5. **Add Cheese:**
   - Remove the dish from the oven, uncover, and sprinkle each pepper with cheese. Return to the oven, uncovered, for another 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

6. **Serve:**
   - Carefully remove the stuffed peppers from the oven. Let them cool for a few minutes.
   - Garnish with chopped cilantro or parsley if desired.
   - Serve warm.
